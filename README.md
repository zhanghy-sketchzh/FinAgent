## Usage

### Data loading

The project provides two main Python scripts to handle data loading in fund reports:

- 'pdf_parser.py' : This script is used to extract and convert the important information from the fund report to text format (.txt).
- 'table_extractor.py' : This script is used to parse the text data extracted through 'pdf_parser.py' and convert the data to Excel table format based on the report directory.
